Task Force 301 is a personnal project, aiming to see to which extent Python and Qt can be use to code a Real Time Strategy game. It also is a way for me to use as much as i know in both Python and Qt, and learn more.

*The very game is very much a Work In Progress !!!*

# In Short
In TaskForce 301, you build a fleet with your available funds: You can choose between 4 type of ships:

  - Battleships
  - Cruisers
  - Destroyers
  - Torpedo boats

Each type have their own advantages and drawbacks, it's up to you to find the good composition for your fleet !
More than the base types, you can also customize every ship by upgrading their tech levels on different fields, like gun accuracy and detection range.

Then let's see how your fleet holds up against the AI !
